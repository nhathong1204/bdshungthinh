Plugins sends information about your website (domain and email) to SiteGuarding server. After successful 
registration your website will get uniq access key. Please note: This action requires your permission 
and confirmation (nothing will be sent to SiteGuarding server without your permission).  

2) Scan process. During the scanning process, plugin will read all the files of your website and will analyze 
them. Information about the files with suspicious codes will be sent to SiteGuarding server for extra analyze 
and for report generation. Generated report will be sent back to you (the copy of the report you will get by 
email)   

Please note: Plugin sends and receives the data to SiteGuarding.com API.
